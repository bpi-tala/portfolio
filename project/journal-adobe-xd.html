				<h3>Journal For XD was created as a personal growth tool for design students.</h3>

				<p>The idea for Journal was inspired by the struggles that design students face when learning how to design. In the beginning stages of the project, I had interviewed early-level design students about their project documentation habits.</p>

				<p>Using that research, I created a plugin tool that would allow them to self-critique and connect elements of a design to their project goals, while also providing a personal journal space to reflect on their thoughts, feelings, and learnings from a project.</p>

			<h3>A year later, I finally decided to do some usability testing as part of a research project.</h3>

			<p>Given that I had never tested my hypothetical creation, I designed a research study to test for learnability — how easy it was for users to perform basic tasks the first time they came across the design — and general user interface understanding over labels, wording, and whether the design met expectations. Users were given 5 tasks to complete:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Adding a project goal</li>
				<li>Adding a note under a project goal</li>
				<li>Showing or hiding the note indicators on the canvas</li>
				<li>Adding a new journal entry</li>
				<li>Viewing an existing journal entry</li>
			</ol>

			</figure>

		</div>

		<div class="center-text">

			<h3>Results showed that users were able to complete most tasks with ease.</h3>

			<p>I recorded the results in a level of completion chart where there were six possible levels of completion — complete success, partial success, and failure, each with the possibility of a user doing the task independently or with assistance.</p>

			<p>The most immediate noticeable item is the column for Task 2. Most users had only partial success with assistance in this area, whereas the rest of the tasks had complete independent success.</p>

				<figcaption>Look at those nifty results</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p class="p-space-above">At the time the original prototype was made, the necessary microinteraction to trigger that task didn't exist in Adobe XD (the software in which the prototype was made). Adding a goal assessment note was meant to be discoverable through a hover state that caused a contextual icon to pop up. Because hover states weren't yet supported in XD, users had to make a physical click in order to show the icon, and it wasn't easily discoverable to the majority of users.</p>

				<h3>Positive quantitative results means I had a good product, right? ... Well, maybe not.</h3>

				<p>Despite the success in testing, the most valuable data came from the qualitative portion of testing. Interestingly, all of the  participants looked at Journal through a work context instead of as a personal learning tool like I had intended.</p>

				<p>The goal assessment portion of Journal didn't have clear functionality. Most of the participants inferred that it was a to-do list or a team collaboration tool, even though I had meant for it to be a self-critiquing tool.</p>

				<p>All of the participants voiced concerns about the journal portion, most notably that it was too personal for work. And because it was too personal for work, there wouldn't be a use for it in a work setting. Would you want to read your coworker's diary? Not many people do.</p>

			<h3>So what happened? I accidentally discovered a new user group — the Working Designer.</h3>

			<p>During the making of Journal, I had interviewed early-level design students that weren't far into their design programs. Because parts of the design process were so new to them, they were more receptive to the idea of having a self-improvement tool for projects in which they were the only designer.</p>

			<p>Conversely, the students I interviewed for usability testing were much further into their design programs, and all of them had worked at an internship or otherwise had real-world design experience. Because of their experience, they were expecting a product that increased their productivity in a team-based environment.</p>

			<h3>What Journal For XD really needed was concept validation, not usability testing.</h3>

			<p>While concept validation and usability testing are interconnected, they are ultimately different things needed at different stages of product design. Asking users if a product is interesting and functional should be separate from asking them to test specific usability issues, and the former is what I had skipped when initially making the Journal plugin concept.</p>

			<p>If I were to continue pursuing this idea, my first priority would be to find out whether a journaling function provides enough value to Adobe XD users to justify keeping it as part of the plugin. Then based on those results, I would tailor the product to reflect the user needs. Doing this would also help me more effectively recruit for any future usability testing because the target audience would be known at that point. Lessons learned!</p>
