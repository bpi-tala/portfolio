				<h3>How can technology play a role in the way people manage their food waste?</h3>

				<p>Inspired by the zero-waste lifestyle trend, I wanted to address the global problem of food waste. Are people aware of how much food is wasted? How knowledgeable are they about food expiration? What would motivate people to be more conscious of their food waste? What are their existing methods of handling food waste?</p>

				<p>One of the most common methods of managing food waste was meal planning, but I noticed many of the existing meal planning apps were centered around weight loss, diet, and eating healthier. Did meal planning alone help people reduce their food waste?</p>

			<h3>Most people fell in the middle of the food waste awareness spectrum.</h3>

			<figure class="fig-space-below">
				<img src="savor/savor-spectrum.png" alt="Spectrum of food waste awareness">
				<figcaption>Tag yourself; I'm the weird grey area</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>People who fell under <strong>uncaring</strong> had little to no knowledge about their personal food waste, and they were less concerned about reducing it for any reason. Food waste wasn't something they consciously thought about.</p>

			<p>Those under <strong>invested</strong> were extremely knowledgable on food waste and were committed to reducing it as much as possible. They also used various methods to reduce waste, including meal prepping, saving leftovers, and composting.</p>

			<p>But the vast majority of people interviewed were neither uncaring nor invested. People in the middle were characterized by having a variety of motivators to reducing food waste, but they also reported inconsistency in their attempts to manage their food waste. The inconsistency stemmed from three main problems:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>It was easy to lose track of purchased food</li>
				<li>True expiration for food was confusing due to different vendor labels</li>
				<li>Planning was perceived as difficult and required "too much" effort and time to calculate portions</li>
			</ul>

				<h3>It was time to upgrade a concept we all loved to hate: the meal planner.</h3>

				<p>I didn't want to reinvent the wheel, just realign it. Everyone I had talked to was familiar with meal planning, and they just needed a way for meal planning to work for them. Because their main goal wasn't necessarily weight loss or dieting (although healthy eating was admittedly a side effect of planning), I included features that directly addressed the three main problems:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>A kitchen and pantry organizer</li>
					<li>A food expiration database</li>
					<li>A recipe ingredient calculator for meal prep</li>
				</ul>

				<figcaption>Mid-fi wireframes and a first attempt at solving some problems</figcaption>
			</figure>

		</div>

		<div class="center-text">

			<h3>The first fix: let's forget about forgetting about food. Enter the digital kitchen.</h3>

			<p>One of the most common sentiments among people I interviewed was that, for one reason or another, they forgot about food they already purchased and often had to throw it out.</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>I’ll buy about 5 bananas expecting that I’ll have one for breakfast each morning. Then when I’m late or I forget, I won’t eat it, and sometimes I’ll have to throw as many as four out.</p>
				<cite>&mdash; Regina, a banana waster</cite>
			</blockquote>

			<p>Additionally, existing literature showed that the most wasted type of food was fresh produce, followed by dairy and meats. Clearly, this seemed to be a universal issue that affected much more than the sample group I had interviewed.</p>

			<p>To combat this, I designed a digital kitchen that would allow users to keep track of their purchased foods. It would also alert users when a food item in their kitchen would be expiring soon. Adding items to a kitchen would be done manually or by taking a picture of a grocery store receipt.</p>

		</div>

			</figure>

		</div>

		<div class="center-text">

			<h3>The second fix: no more guesswork when food goes bad! Here's an expiration database.</h3>

			<p>Another point of confusion was on true food expiration. In truth, most grocery store labels are for the vendor and indicate "peak freshness" but don't tell the consumer when food is truly inedible.</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>When there's expiration, sell by, and use by, how the hell am I supposed to know what each of those means?</p>
				<cite>&mdash; Ian, a passionate but confused shopper</cite>
			</blockquote>

			<p>Most people I talked to reported using sense of taste or smell as an indicator of when food went bad, but this method was also inconsistent for those that admitted to having poorer senses.</p>

			<p>To address this, I decided to include a food database so users could properly assess the freshness of foods. Ideally, this information would be partnered with already existing expiration databases such <a href="http://www.eatbydate.com/" target="_blank">Eat By Date</a> (where this sample information came from).</p>

		<div class="center-text">

			<h3>The third fix: too much effort to meal plan? Welcome to the ingredient calculator.</h3>

			<p>The last pain point for reducing food waste was about the time and effort it took to meal plan. Most people didn't want to eat the same thing for multiple days, and calculating correct portions seemed like a hassle.</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>We’d also have to figure out portions and whatnot for a family of four, and that’s not very ideal. I don't have that kind of time.</p>
				<cite>&mdash; Jason, a busy father</cite>
			</blockquote>

			<p>By having a recipe database that calculated needed ingredients based on how many servings were being made, it took the effort off the user and reduced the time spent calculating to just a click of a few buttons. Ingredients were then added to a grocery list, and any existing ingredients in the user's kitchen would appear checked off.</p>

		<div class="center-text">

			<h3>I did it! I was able to tackle food waste by using the user-centered design process.</h3>

			<p>For a problem that seemed incredibly large to start with, I found the trick was to really dig into the roots and keep asking why. Why did people waste food? Why did they forget they had purchased food? Why was it difficult for them to assess freshness? Why did they think meal planning required so much effort?</p>

			<p>Uncovering the root causes to a problem is really the heart and soul of product design, and it's something that I loved sinking my teeth into. Knowing that you're actively making something as functional as it is beautiful makes all the research and sketches worth it!</p>
