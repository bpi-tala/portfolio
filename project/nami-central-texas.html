				<h3>How do we diversify donor funds and increase donor retention within four months?</h3>

				<p>Business goals are never the same as user goals. As an experience designer, it's up to me to find the intersection between business needs and user needs, and satisfy both. My team decided to take a page from Google's HEART framework as a way to connect donor experience to NAMI's business goals.</p>

				<p>By interviewing donors of various causes on their charitable giving habits, we identified key points in the donor journey that related to our desired goals of donor happiness, adoption, and retention.</p>

			<h3>Donor happiness, adoption, and retention hinges on empathy, information, and imapct.</h3>

			<p><strong>Empathy is the vehicle that drives donors through the donation process.</strong> Donors should feel connected to the importance of their giving, and this connection is created through experiencing personal struggle or storytelling that helps them identify with people outside their immediate circles.</p>

			<p><strong>Information builds trust and allows donors to commit to an organization.</strong> This is established by the transparency of goals and finances, as well as the availability and credibility of information about the organization.</p>

			<p><strong>Impact is the catalyst for a donor to donate again.</strong> It connects them to their original motivators and pushes them to repeat the process. Donor impact includes feeling valued and appreciated by the organization, as well as the donor feeling like they have made an impact by donating.</p>

			<p>Using these insights from our research, we used the HEART framework to connect our known user goals to the business goals given to us by NAMI.</p>

				<h3>But users struggled with a lack of information and sense of appreciation on the existing NAMI website.</h3>

				<p>Although users had no issues completing the task of making a donation, a majority of them had trouble trusting the information presented because of vague wording on donation levels. There was also confusion on what donor funds were being used for.</p>

				<p>On the thank you page, most users were distracted by the amount of times the words "thank you" appeared on the page. The small text and largely empty space also made the page feel lackluster. One user even expected the page to be "more celebratory."</p>

			<h3>What changes could we make under tight visual design constraints?</h3>

			<p>The NAMI Central Texas site was made using a Wordpress theme that we didn't have access to, so our options in changing the website visuals were very limited. Because of this, we opted to focus on copy, content, and small visual changes that were the most feasible given the Wordpress theme, while also being the most valuable for potential donors.</p>

		<div class="center-text">

			<h3>We made information more available, helping users build trust in NAMI.</h3>

			<p>By increasing the visibility of the case statement on the donate page, users got a better sense of NAMI's services and mission. Conextualizing and enhancing the copy took away much of the vagueness and distrust that users initially felt.</p>

			<h3>Valued. Appreciated. Empowered. That's how we wanted donors to feel after giving.</h3>

			<p>We enhanced the copy to sound more inviting without it being saccharin. Including an invitation to NAMI Walks (an annual 5k walk) and adding a social media sharing option made users feel like they were invited to do more without the site seeming pushy or intrusive.</p>

			<p>Our user research indicated that 50% of users didn't read the emails sent by the organizations they donate to. For many of them, the thank you page was the last time they would be able to see the impact of their donation. We inlcuded an annual impact report and a personal testimony, which helped users feel like they'd made an impact in the life of someone with a mental health condition.</p>

			<h3>Here's what I learned along the way:</h3>

			<p>Designers aren't going to be with a project forever, so how do we know we're making the right decisions without seeing long-term quantitative metrics? It's about taking insights from user research and connecting user goals to those metrics. Contextualizing and understanding how user problems directly relate to business goals helps the business grow.</p>
